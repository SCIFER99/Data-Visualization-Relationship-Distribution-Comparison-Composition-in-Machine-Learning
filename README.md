# Data-Visualization-Relationship-Distribution-Comparison-Composition-in-Machine-Learning
If we want to visualize what's going on in Machine Learning/AI development, here are 4 ways to do so! 

Step1: Make sure you have these packages installed before implementation:

      pip3 install pandas
      pip3 install matplotlib
      
Step2: Even though I developed this in an IDE, it is best seen in Jupyter Notebooks (as mentioned in the script)

Happy Coding!
